	I had always thought them<br>
	overrated<br>
	after all<br>
	I gave you a dozen<br>
	after our big fight<br>
	and you barely looked at them<br>
	until they were withered and colorless<br>
	and then you thought I was so sweet<br>
	for giving you this bundle of dead plants.<br>
	It must be me<br>
	an uncultured white rose<br>
	so out of place<br>
	in a world of color and protocol.<br>
	every thorn<br>
	I've grasped with bloody hands<br>
	has reminded me<br>
	that my words<br>
	are only modulated noise.<br>
	I could never give you<br>
	the correct time of day<br>
	but I can always give you roses.<br><br><br>
