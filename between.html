<strong>
	I regained consciousness<BR>
	just as the rain became heavy.<BR>
	I did not move.<BR>
	I had dreamed that I was on fire<BR>
	standing on the platform<BR>
	while the train moaned<BR>
	into the station.<BR>
	the conductor offered me a drink<BR>
	from a brown paper bag.<BR>
	I declined.<BR>
	awakened by thunder<BR>
	I clawed at the tall crabgrass.<BR>
	turnpike traffic <BR>
	streamed in the distance<BR>
	but could not see<BR>
	the words formed on my lips<BR>
	the name<BR>
	I can no longer hear.<BR><BR><BR>
