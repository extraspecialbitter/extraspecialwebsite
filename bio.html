<blockquote>
<font face=tahoma size=3><strong>
Paul David Mena made his debut in Life as we know it an unspecified
number of years ago in the quasi-conscious state of New York.  
Through some obvious oversight, he graduated from 
<A HREF="http://www.hofstra.edu/">Hofstra University</A> in 1982 
with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.  Paul currently
draws a salary from 
<A HREF="http://www.whoi.edu/">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</A>
where he ostensibly functions as a DevOps Engineer.  Paul is
happily <a href="./wedding.html">married</a> to
<a href="./mary.html">Mary</a> and has five 
<a href="./newkids.html">children</a> and a cantankerous
<a href="./bonita.html">dingo</a>.

In his spare time, Paul writes 
<a href="./paul_poems.shtml">poetry</a>, 
particularly
<a href="http://www.haikupoet.com/">haiku</a>.
Another ongoing project 
is an unauthorized autobiography, which will be written posthumously.<BR>
