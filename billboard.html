	that kind of perfection <BR>
	cannot be rehearsed.<BR>
	it has to be instinctive.<BR>
	the way your shoulders <BR>
	lean into him<BR>
	it is clear<BR>
	that he is not pulling you closer<BR>
	with his arm<BR>
	but rather draping it<BR>
	around the back of your neck<BR>
	like a scarf.<BR>
	your hands<BR>
	could be reaching for his<BR>
	but instead<BR>
	they tighten into fists<BR>
	not resisting<BR>
	but hungrily bracing<BR>
	for the kiss<BR>
	which you allow<BR>
	to tilt your head back<BR>
	at an angle that suggests<BR>
	that you are willingly overpowered.<BR>
	your eyes<BR>
	could be clenched shut<BR>
	but through your long lashes<BR>
	you gaze unfocused<BR>
	beyond your two dimensions<BR>
	into the dark paralysis<BR>
	of my lust.<BR><BR><BR>
