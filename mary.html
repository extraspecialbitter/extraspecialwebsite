<strong>
<blockquote>
Mary Melodee Mena made her debut in life as we know it an unspecified
number of years ago in the tiny city of Munising in the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
She attended <A HREF="http://www.msu.edu/">Michigan State University</A> 
but eventually headed east and has called Boston her home for many years.
Mary is the founder and owner of
<A HREF="http://www.newboston.net/">New Boston Promotions</A>
and is the special events chairperson for the
<A HREF="http://www.bostonblues.com/">Boston Blues Society</A>.
When she isn't feeding her dog 
<a href="http://www.newboston.net/bonita.html">Bonita</a> and/or
five <a href="http://www.extraspecialbitter.com/newkids.html">stepchildren</a>
she tries to find time to snap a photo or two... always with the hope of
intertwining them with her husband's haiku.
