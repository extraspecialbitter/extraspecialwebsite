	we'll never have Paris.<br>
	I'll have<br>
	another bourbon<br>
	straight up.<br>
	don't let my glass<br>
	go empty<br>
	if you know what's good for you.<br>
	are my eyes really brown?<br>
	I haven't seen them<br>
	since they were reflected in yours<br>
	not an easy day to forget<br>
	the sky was grey and you wore blue.<br>
	we were so in love<br>
	with that song<br>
	we missed our exit<br>
	and drove into a place<br>
	that wasn't on the map.<br>
	is that cannon fire<br>
	or did my ulcer<br>
	just press the panic button?<br>
	the last train <br>
	is leaving the station<br>
	but I'm staying put <br>
	after all<br>
	I've only taken two sips of my drink.<br>
	I ran with you once<br>
	I couldn't bare to do it again.<br>
	here's looking beyond you, kid.<br><br><br>
