	I was just beginning to get comfortable <br>
	with the anaesthesia<br>
	when the background music<br>
	became disturbingly familiar.<br>
	I couldn't make the transition<br>
	from sidewalk cafe<br>
	to underwater cavern.<br>
	and when the death machinery<br>
	had faded to a melodic hum<br>
	I wanted to kill the blackbird<br>
	outside my window.<br>
	I need another drink<br>
	but thirty tons of stainless steel<br>
	are hanging from my mouth.<br>
	the ceiling is on fire<br>
	I am swallowing Alaska<br>
	and I feel nothing.<br>
	Elvis has bought a round<br>
	for everyone at the bar.<br>
	I hate Elvis.<br>
	but I live at the bar.<br>
	clouds of flame<br>
	descend upon the pool<br>
	which is empty.<br>
	where is my monogram?<br>
	I need another drink<br>
	but the dentist is not cooperating.<br>
	I could break him in half<br>
	with a flick of my Bic.<br>
	instead<br>
	I write this poem.<br><br><br>
