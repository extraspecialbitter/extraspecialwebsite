<h3>Trey&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;a very special foster pup</h3>
<p>
While working one day in June, I received a call from a frantic woman at a vet&#8217;s office.  They had a 
5-week old pup that had been dropped off at their office to be put to sleep.  She told me they needed to 
amputate his leg, but they couldn&#8217;t find anyone to take him and they would put him to sleep that day 
if our rescue could&#8217;t take him.  He&#8217;d already been there two days and they weren&#8217;t 
feeding him much, because they would perform amputation surgery as soon as they found someone to take him.
</p>

<p>
I was on my way to a meeting and in a hurry, so I told her to amputate and assured her that I&#8217;d 
call her back in a few hours, once I found a foster home for him.  I sat in meetings for the next few 
hours and kept wondering what happened to the poor pup&#8217;s leg. 
</p>

<p>
So as soon as I left work I called back and asked if they&#8217;d amputated yet; she said no, the vet was 
just finishing up with other patients and the pup was waiting his turn.  I asked what was wrong with the 
leg and she said &#8220;it&#8217;s broken!&#8221; 
</p>

<p>
Turns out that he&#8217;d been stepped on at some point and both bones in the top of his right leg were 
broken in half.  I spoke to the vet and he was confident it could be fixed, by a specialist, but he had 
been going to amputate because it was cheaper than surgery!
</p>

<p>
So at 5-1/2 weeks, the pup took a 4-hour road trip, with all 4 legs still attached, and became our 
youngest foster dog.  We named him Trey&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;since he was minutes away from having only 
3 legs!
</p>

<p>
Trey went to an Ortho Specialist at 6 weeks, the x-rays showed the bones were not aligned; they were 
healing side-by-side, instead of end-to-end.  But his bones were too soft at that point to re-break 
and pin straight.  The plan was to bring him back in mid-September for a 
follow-up to have the leg re-broken and set at that point.
</p>

<p>
From Day One he&#8217;s been a wonderful foster pup, a typical mischievous 
ACD puppy.  The leg seemed to be stable enough to allow normal puppy activity, 
although in the beginning it was clearly crooked and hurt occasionally when 
he bumped it.  A few weeks later we&#8217;re delighted to say that his leg has
healed completely&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;no further surgeries will be required!
