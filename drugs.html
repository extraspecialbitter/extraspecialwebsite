	by the time her idol takes the stage<br>
	she can barely lift her head.<br>
	in her best black leather whine<br>
	she begs her boyfriend <br>
	to take her home<br>
	but he won't leave<br>
	until after the encore.<br>
	pouting<br>
	she adjusts her hair<br>
	and glares at me.<br>
	thank god <br>
	she still has the wherewithall<br>
	to hate a curious stranger.<br>
	but when Robyn sings<br>
	to his Dark Princess<br>
	she straightens herself up enough<br>
	to stare into the lights<br>
	before she buries <br>
	her face in her hands<br>
	and sobs.<br><br><br>
