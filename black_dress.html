        the federales <br>
        are at the door <br>
        and I smell like <br>
        a brewery. <br>
        they know I'm here <br>
        but we play the game -- <br>
        they knock <br>
        I turn down the stereo <br>
        and eventually  <br>
        the knocking stops <br>
        just in time <br>
        for the migraine <br>
        to kick in. <br>
        as the saying goes <br>
        you are a sight for sore eyes <br>
        -- and mine are bloodshot. <br>
        you smile <br>
        and ask <br>
        where we're eating tonight <br>
        knowing my sorry condition <br>
        but wearing <br>
        that sleek black dress -- <br>
        the one we bought together <br>
        promising not <br>
        to tell your mom. <br>
        I shower <br>
        and shave <br>
        and brush my teeth <br>
        a thousand times <br>
        and saunter past <br>
        the federales <br>
        my arm around you <br>
        while they hide their eyes <br>
        and dream <br>
        of the next  <br>
        covert operation <br>
        and that sleek black dress. <br> <br> <br>
