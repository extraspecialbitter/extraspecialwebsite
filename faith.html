	I really liked her last night --<br>
	enough to finally accept my role<br>
	as gracious loser<br>
	with a smile on my face.<br>
	God, did I really smile?<br>
	yes, I did.<br>
	and I meant it <br>
	when I wished her well<br>
	and I drank her appreciation<br>
	of my sudden maturity<br>
	without the requisite sweet-and-low.<br>
	I didn't even lust for her.<br>
	don't worry - I'm back to lusting now -<br>
	but then it was different<br>
	her eyes were soothing<br>
	instead of intoxicating<br>
	and I was so so content<br>
	to be still<br>
	while she moved on.<br>
	what's happening to me?<br>
	once, when I believed,<br>
	the answer was always<br>
	a comfortable distance away.<br>
	now it's close enough<br>
	to weave bright white streaks<br>
	in my hair.<br>
	now I withdraw the question<br>
	and wait.<br><br><br>
