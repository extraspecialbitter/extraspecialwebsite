<strong>south central bell<BR><hR>
<FONT size=4>
	a pay phone on the corner<br>
	rings unanswered.<br>
	it isn't mine.<br>
	I can't see the ocean<br>
	but I can taste the salt in the air.<br>
	hurrying past me<br>
	terms of endearment<br>
	are uttered <br>
	with the sincerity of a sneeze.<br>
	no one asks me<br>
	what I'm writing<br>
	or why<br>
	but they all eye me with suspicion.<br>
	and with good reason, of course.<br>
	I say I'm nearly through waiting<br>
	but it obviously hasn't been long enough.<br>
	not even a whisper of reprieve.<br>
	more pedestrian traffic weighs in<br>
	chatting cheerfully until they see me.<br>
	why am I here?<br>
	the foundation of metaphysics.<br>
	how long will I stay?<br>
	foundation and too much blush.<br>
	laughter spills out onto the sidewalk<br>
	with no one to clean up after it.<br>
	shops are closing right and left<br>
	and yet no one<br>
	wants to know <br>
	what I'm waiting for.<br>
	maybe that's not true.<br>
	maybe they all want to know.<br>
	maybe they all know already.<br>
	the flags are taken down.<br>
	the lights are turned off.<br>
	finally <br>
	my hands are turning blue.<br>
	there are more reasons<br>
	to leave <br>
	than to stay<br>
	even though I only needed one.<br>
	the last pedestrian<br>
	was downright frightened.<br>
	am I so indistinguishable<br>
	from the shadows?<br>
	maybe I'll wait<br>
	until I've filled the page<br>
	although I've already said <br>
	far too much<br>
	about nothing at all.<br>
	I have a fantasy<br>
	in which I walk away<br>
	and finally hear the phone ring<br>
	only to continue walking<br>
	never turning back.<br>
	what will happen instead<br>
	of course<br>
	is that I'll stay here<br>
	until I freeze solid<br>
	and the phone will never ring.<br>
	every few steps <br>
	I will look over my shoulder<br>
	at the silent phone.<br>
	every few steps<br>
	I will hear it ringing<br>
	somewhere else.<br><br><br>
