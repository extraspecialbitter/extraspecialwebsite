<FONT size=4>
	Rick knew this blind date<br>
	would be no better than the others --<br>
	two noisy mosquitoes<br>
	trying to drive away the heat<br>
	with their wings.<br>
	these were not the wings<br>
	that took her away from him<br>
	but he couldn't shake the image:<br>
	she is on that plane<br>
	and is leaving me forever.<br>
	an attractive woman waited for him<br>
	at the Blue Parrot.<br>
	"You must be Rick", she said.<br>
	"I must be", he replied,<br>
	"but I really can't stay -<br>
	please accept my apologies".<br>
	she protested mildly.<br>
	he paid for her drink.<br>
	she grabbed her purse<br>
	and disappeared into the dust.<br>
	he bought a bottle of bourbon<br>
	settled into a shady corner<br>
	and flew back to Paris.<br><br><br>
