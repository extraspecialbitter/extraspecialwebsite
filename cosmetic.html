	I drank too much.<BR>
	but I wasn't nearly drunk enough<BR>
	to forget<BR>
	the look in your eyes<BR>
	betraying your words<BR>
	which were betraying me.<BR>
	it forces me<BR>
	to wonder which you it was<BR>
	I met that night.<BR>
	were you finally yourself<BR>
	emboldened by beer?<BR>
	or were you frightened<BR>
	into acting out a tragedy<BR>
	written by anonymous ghosts?<BR>
	I want to silence the thunder<BR>
	that disturbs your sleep.<BR>
	I want to touch your face<BR>
	without make-up.<BR><BR><BR>
