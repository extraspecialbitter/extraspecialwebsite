	by the time I had reached<BR>
	the second toll plaza<BR>
	Courtney Love<BR>
	had faded to static.<BR>
	I could still smell the city<BR>
	through my open window.<BR>
	I paid exact change<BR>
	accepted a bright plastic thank you<BR>
	and drove into white noise.<BR>
	snow was beginning to appear on the shoulder<BR>
	afraid of the city<BR>
	perfectly at ease in the suburbs<BR>
	mariachi station wagons<BR>
	replaced with eighteen-wheelers.<BR>
	one of them blew past me<BR>
	while I gripped the wheel with both hands<BR>
	wishing I'd had a rocket launcher.<BR>
	too many miles of this.<BR>
	too many miles between us.<BR>
	the grey sky was already suffocating<BR>
	the lavender fragrance I left behind.<BR>
	I turned off the radio<BR>
	and daydreamed<BR>
	riding the steam<BR>
	of your jasmine tea<BR>
	away from Chicago.<BR><BR><BR>
