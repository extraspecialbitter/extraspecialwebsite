       it was some time <BR>
       after the third <BR>
       or fourth beer -- <BR>
       the one I knew <BR>
       I shouldn't finish -- <BR>
       that the gentle spinning <BR>
       turned to turbulence  <BR>
       and the streetlights <BR>
       became fireflies <BR>
       I could never catch. <BR>
       outside my window <BR>
       the crickets sang <BR>
       knowing all along <BR>
       that the flying horse <BR>
       would never leave <BR>
       and that the lights <BR>
       dimmed promptly  <BR>
       at midnight <BR>
       the exact time <BR>
       that I had planned <BR>
       to leave my body <BR>
       and ride <BR>
       above the traffic <BR>
       above the turbulence <BR>
       into the paradise <BR>
       of sleep. <BR> <BR> <BR>
