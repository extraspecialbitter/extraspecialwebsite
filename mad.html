	Paul and Jamie are so in love<BR>
	I want to scream.<BR>
	so it's easy to forget<BR>
	that they are really<BR>
	Paul of the wide-eyed one-liner<BR>
	and Helen who chases men who chase tornados.<BR>
	their New York City<BR>
	was never my New York City.<BR>
	their Waverly Theatre<BR>
	ignores the initials <BR>
	I carved into a seat<BR>
	when I grew tired of reading subtitles.<BR>
	passing the news stand<BR>
	there was no trace<BR>
	of my beautiful bride-to-be.<BR>
	a stray dog<BR>
	who looked nothing like Murray<BR>
	sniffed a black trash bag<BR>
	and marked it.<BR>
	on Seventh Avenue<BR>
	my life was re-enacted by a mime<BR>
	when I stopped to buy a two-dollar tie.<BR>
	it didn't take very long.<BR>
	when he was done<BR>
	he thrust out his palm and smiled.<BR>
	I gave him the tie.<BR>
	he frowned and gave it back to me.<BR>
	then I changed the channel.<BR><BR><BR>
